# Satisfeed - Data Collection & Dashboard

## Description  
In Spring 2025, Team Satisfeed partnered with the nonprofit Satisfeed, which provides hunger relief for families in and around Gwinnett County through food co-ops and weekend programs. Their mission is to fight food insecurity, reduce waste, and connect communities. The team created a data-driven dashboard using Google Colab and Power BI to visualize client demographics and service usage, giving the organization insights for program planning and resource allocation.



In Fall 2025, Let Us Cook will build on this work by adding Gwinnett County school zone data to the existing web app dashboard, enabling Satisfeed to better understand and serve families across the area.

2. Dashboard demo was given at Georgia Gwinnett College's CREATE Symposium 4/24/2025

## Technologies and Usage

Data was analyzed and visualized using Google Collab, a cloud version of the Python-based Jupyter Notebook. Project management was conducted using Jira. Dashboard
layout was created in Power BI for later implementation in Javascript by Thanh Tran. The final project will include a database and password-protected site where the 
dashboard can be viewed by Satisfeed employees.

## Spring 2025 Project Progress

Disclaimer: The notebook,dataset, and PBIX file cannot be displayed, as they contain personal information of Satisfeed customers including full names, addresses, and phone numbers. Therefore, all displayed metrics and stats are a high-level overview of the analysis without specific data points displayed.

### Analysis Methods
PCA and linear regression were attempted on the data set, but failed due to a lack of numerical data and numerous gaps in client reporting. As a result, most of the 
statistics are simple descriptive ones.

One of the key findings related to a possible motivation for clients using Satisfeed. Of clients who answered demographic questions, 30% reported being unemployed or 
employed only part time. Additionally, the most common income bracket for Satisfeed clients was in the 0-25k range. This suggests that many clients come to Satisfeed 
because they are experiencing financial difficulties.

Another key finding was the background of Satisfeed clients. Of clients who answered, almost 80% were Hispanic or Latino. This may indicate a need for Satisfeed to 
develop bilingual programming, in order to reach those among their client base more confident in Spanish than English.

### Remaining Scope
It would be optimal to pull data to the dashboard straight from Satisfeeds database, for which plug-in compatibility with PowerBI would have to be researched. The 
client would also like the "lbs of food served" card to be real time where they can live update the data. As of now the card pulls static data from a hypothetical table 
and is used as a placeholder.
