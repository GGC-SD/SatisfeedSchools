## Outreach Activities

1. Poster was presented at Georgia Gwinnett College's Student Talent and Research Showcase (STARS) 4/17/2025
2. Dashboard demo was given at Georgia Gwinnett College's CREATE Symposium 4/24/2025

## Technologies and Usage

Data was analyzed and visualized using Google Collab, a cloud version of the Python-based Jupyter Notebook. Project management was conducted using Jira. Dashboard
layout was created in Power BI for later implementation in Javascript by Thanh Tran. The final project will include a database and password-protected site where the 
dashboard can be viewed by Satisfeed employees.

## Spring 2025 Project Progress

The notebook and dataset cannot be displayed, as they contain personal information of Satisfeed customers including full names, addresses, and phone numbers. Therefore, 
this will be a high-level overview of the analysis without specific data points displayed.

### Analysis Methods
PCA and linear regression were attempted on the data set, but failed due to a lack of numerical data and numerous gaps in client reporting. As a result, most of the 
statistics are simple descriptive ones.

One of the key findings related to a possible motivation for clients using Satisfeed. Of clients who answered demographic questions, 30% reported being unemployed or 
employed only part time. Additionally, the most common income bracket for Satisfeed clients was in the 0-25k range. This suggests that many clients come to Satisfeed 
because they are experiencing financial difficulties.

Another key finding was the background of Satisfeed clients. Of clients who answered, almost 80% were Hispanic or Latino. This may indicate a need for Satisfeed to 
develop bilingual programming, in order to reach those among their client base more confident in Spanish than English.
